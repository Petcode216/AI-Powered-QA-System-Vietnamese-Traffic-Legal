This project develops an **AI-powered chatbot** that provides **legal consultation on Vietnamese traffic laws** using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It integrates **PhoBERT** for legal text retrieval and **viT5** for natural answer generation, forming a **two-stage Question Answering (QA) pipeline**.  

The goal is to make complex legal information **accessible, accurate, and user-friendly**, helping the public understand traffic regulations and promoting road safety.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Domain**: Vietnamese Traffic Law  
- **Models Used**:
  - **PhoBERT** (bi-encoder): Extracts and retrieves relevant law clauses.  
  - **viT5** (seq2seq): Generates natural, simplified Vietnamese answers.  
- **Interface**: A Streamlit-based chatbot application.  
- **Core Contribution**: A two-stage QA pipeline tailored for low-resource Vietnamese legal NLP.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Accurate & Contextual Responses**  
   Fine-tune PhoBERT and viT5 for precise retrieval and fluent answer generation.  

2. **Enhanced Public Understanding**  
   Translate complex legal jargon into concise, clear Vietnamese.  

3. **Efficiency for Legal Professionals**  
   Automate common inquiries, reducing workload for lawyers.  

---

## ⚖️ Problem Statement
Vietnamese traffic law is written in **complex, domain-specific legal language**, making it difficult for the general public to understand.  
Challenges include:
- Limited annotated datasets for Vietnamese law.  
- Nuances in Vietnamese language (tones, specialized terms).  
- Need for transforming technical clauses into **user-friendly answers**.  

---

## 🔧 System Architecture
### Two-stage QA Pipeline
1. **Retrieval (PhoBERT Bi-Encoder)**
   - Encodes queries & legal texts into embeddings.
   - Retrieves the most relevant law snippet.
   - Supports dual models:
     - `phobert-traffic` (general traffic law)
     - `phobert-168` (fine-related queries)

2. **Generation (viT5 Seq2Seq)**
   - Input: user query + retrieved law context.  
   - Output: fluent Vietnamese answer grounded in legal text.  

3. **UI Integration**
   - Built with **Streamlit**.
   - Displays both generated answer + referenced law (Điều, Khoản, Điểm).

## 📥 Pretrained Models  
All pretrained weights are hosted on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/your-username/AI-POWERED-QA-SYSTEM-VIETNAMESE-TRAFFIC-LEGAL).
The repo contains:
retrieval/
├── phobert-168/ → Trained on Nghị định 168/2024/NĐ-CP (fine-related queries)
└── phobert-atgt/ → Trained on Luật Giao thông Đường bộ (general traffic queries)
generation/
└── vit5-finetuned/ → Vietnamese T5 for answer generation

⚠️ Limitations

Restricted to Vietnamese Road Traffic Law.

Does not provide personalized legal advice.

Accuracy depends on dataset quality.

Currently supports Vietnamese only.

---

🔮 Future Work

Extend coverage to other legal domains (criminal, civil, labor law).

Enhance query routing with intent classification.

Deploy cross-platform (Zalo, Messenger, web).

Explore reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for answer optimization.

Semi-automated legal data updates for law changes.
